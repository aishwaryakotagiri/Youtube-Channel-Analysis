YOUTUBE CHANNEL ANALYSIS

Hey there! 
This little script â€” DA.py â€” is like a data detective for YouTube.
You give it a YouTube channel, and it gives you back the latest 10 videos, sorted by view count, all wrapped in a pretty bar chart. 

What does DA.py do?
  - Connects to a YouTube channelâ€™s video tab

  - Extracts the latest 10 videos using yt-dlp

  - Fetches each videoâ€™s title, view count, and link

  - Visualizes it all in a colorful horizontal bar chart

  - Saves a .csv file so you can explore the data later

Itâ€™s simple, visual, and surprisingly satisfying to see which videos are performing best.

How to use it
1. Install the libraries
  pip install yt-dlp matplotlib seaborn pandas
2. Open DA.py
  Change the channel_url to your favorite channelâ€™s Videos tab:
  channel_url = 'https://www.youtube.com/c/Veritasium/videos'
3. Run the script
  python DA.py

What you'll see
  - A list of 10 video titles + links in your terminal
  - A stylish chart of view counts
  - A CSV file: youtube_channel_analysis.csv with full data

Output Example (Console)
